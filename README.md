Currently we upload the script, which illustrates how we made all figures in the manuscript. This is in *All_figures*.

To explain better what is shown in the fig1A we made one extra script *Figure_1A*.

What if we change a threshold for the Ich is illustrated in *Ich_thresholds*

The replication of the regression modelling results is given in the python script *Sim_iterations*

Note that each script is in two formats, one is script only, other is presentation format (pdf or html)
